# Semantic-segmentation-through-Masked-RCNN
In this project Semantic Segmentation is conducted using a Masked RCNN model and through trained COCO weights.

The test image is given as follows:


The output of the model is such that it displays bounding boxes over the detected objects as well as a mask segmenting the detected object from the background.
The output is given as follows:
